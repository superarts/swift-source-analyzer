# Swift Source Analyzer

THIS FILE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

This repo provides libraries and CLI tools to analyze and generate Swift source code.

## Components

- [SwiftWheel](SwiftWheel): a common helper library that reinvents all sort of wheels in Swift.
- [Unit tests generator](UnitTestsGenerator): a CLI tool that generates unit tests for your project.

## History

A long time ago, I created [swift-source-kit](https://github.com/superarts/swift-source-kit) with Ruby as static analyzer for the Swift language. I've been doing more and more Swift programming in the past few years, so it's time to redo everything **properly** using Swift again.
