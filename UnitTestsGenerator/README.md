# Unit Tests Generator

This CLI tool is based on [SwiftWheel][../SwiftWheel], and it generates Swift unit tests automatically. Check [the usage page](USAGE.md) for details.

This project is still under development and most QOL needs to be improved, but it's fully functional despite of the poor implementation.
